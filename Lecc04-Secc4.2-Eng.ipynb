This way, it avoids introducing rational numbers into the matrix.\n\nBut if we do not mind generating rational components, we can take fewer steps by directly adding a rational amount to one vector from another. \n\n-   The method above searched for the first non-zero number in the first column (the pivot of the first column) and nullified the elements remaining to its right. It started with the first column of the matrix and followed the same pattern, moving left to right across all the columns of the matrix (which in the book has been referred to as [*left-to-right elimination*](https://mbujosab.github.io/CursoDeAlgebraLineal/libro.pdf#subsection.4.2.1)). However, it could have started with the last column applying elimination from right to left. It could also have sought the last non-zero number in the last column and used it to nullify the values to its right.\n\n-   The method above only nullified the elements of each pivot’s row that were to its right, but it could have also nullified those to its left.\n\n-   The method above performs operations with the columns. However, most textbooks apply the elimination between rows from top to bottom (*we will see row operations later*). Or we could have eliminated the values to the right of each pivot from the right (using column operations), and the values below (using row operations).\n\n-   The method above does not reorder the columns so that the pivots appear in a descending staircase arrangement with null columns to the right of non-null ones. But Gaussian elimination does.\n\n-   The method above does not normalize the pivots to be one. However, Gauss-Jordan elimination does.\n\nIn other words, there are many ways to apply elementary transformations to a matrix to achieve another matrix with more zeros than the original matrix. `Elim(B)` implements a very specific way of doing this.\n\nInternally, `Elim(B)` creates a copy of the matrix `B` and calls the procedure `elim()` to execute the operations in a very specific manner. \nBut the procedure `elim()` has many ways to implement the elimination. \nThe choice of each of these methods is made with the argument `variant`.\n\n-   **`variant`:** allows selecting the variant of elimination we wish to apply:\n    \n    **Possible values**.\n    \n    -   0 (by columns, left to right): This is the default option and avoids adding multiples of one column to another if that multiple results from multiplication by a rational number.\n    -   +1 (fast reduction): Performs fewer steps, as it nullifies each element with a single Type I operation (but as a trade-off, rational numbers may appear in the process).\n    -   +2 (double reduction): If the elimination is performed with column operations, it makes zeros to the right *and to the left* of each pivot (if it is by rows, it makes zeros above and below each pivot).\n    -   +4 (by rows): Row operations (if nothing else is indicated, the elimination goes from top to bottom using the first non-zero component of each row as a pivot and avoiding fractions if possible).\n    -   +10 (normalization of the pivots): Once the matrix is pre-echeloned, Type II transformations are applied to normalize the pivots so that all have the value `1`.\n    -   +20 (echelone the matrix): Once the matrix is pre-echeloned, the columns (or rows) are reordered to obtain a staggered form.\n    -   +100 (backward): If operating by columns: right-to-left elimination (using the last non-zero element of each column as a pivot). If operating by rows: bottom-up elimination (using the last non-zero element of each row as a pivot).\n\nBy default `arg = 0`: (simple forward reduction, by columns, avoiding fractions).\n\nWe indicate whether we want the steps to be displayed with the argument `rep`:\n\n-   **rep:** representation with $\\LaTeX$ of the steps taken. Default value `rep=False` (does not show the steps). Any non-empty value other than `0` or `False` will cause the elimination steps to be displayed.\n\nThe way to manage the different variants is to sum the numbers for each option; this number corresponds to the type of elimination desired.\n\nFor example, `1+2+4+100=107` is elimination by fast reduction, on both sides of each pivot, by rows (therefore, double reduction means there are zeros above and below each pivot, and backward means top-to-bottom here).
